An API, or Application Programming Interface is and why you should use them. 
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary 
that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook,
send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.


When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone. The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. This is what an API is - all of this happens via API.Here is a real-life API example. You may be familiar with the process of searching flights online. Just like the restaurant, you have a variety of options to choose from, including different cities, departure and return dates, and more. Let us imagine that you’re booking you are flight on an airline website. You choose a departure city and date, a return city and date, cabin class, as well as other variables. In order to book your flight, you interact with the airline’s website to access their database and see if any seats are available on those dates and what the costs might be.


## The Modern API

Over the years, what an “API” is has often described any sort of generic connectivity interface to an application. More recently, however, the modern API has taken on some characteristics that make them extraordinarily valuable and useful:


1.     Modern APIs adhere to standards (typically HTTP and REST), that are developer-friendly, easily accessible and understood broadly
2.     They are treated more like products than code. They are designed for consumption for specific audiences (e.g., mobile developers),
       they are documented, and they are versioned in a way that users can have certain expectations of its maintenance and lifecycle.
3.     Because they are much more standardized, they have a much stronger discipline for security and governance, as well as monitored 
       and managed for performance and scale
4.     As any other piece of productized software, the modern API has its own software development lifecycle (SDLC) of designing, 
       testing, building, managing, and versioning.Also,modern APIs are well documented for consumption and versioning.
